# Champions League Group Standings Predictions 2020

In this study, I predicted the match outcomes, thus the group standings in UEFA Champions League
season 2019-2020 by developing a statistical model that uses player ratings to determine the outcome of the match.

**Datasets used:**
1. FIFA 19 player dataset
2. FIFA 20 player dataset
3. 2018-2019 match results from top European Leagues

**Models Developed:**
1. A predictor model will be developed using 2018-2019 match results and player dataset.
2. After the model is complete it will be used to predict Champions League match outcomes using FIFA 20 player dataset.
